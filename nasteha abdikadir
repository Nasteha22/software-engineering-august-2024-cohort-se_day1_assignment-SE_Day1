Software engineering is  a  discipline within computer science that is focused on the systematic design development testing and maintenance of software systems
Its importances within the technology industry include
- Innovation. Software engineering allows for the innovation of apps and websites that help solve issues within our society.
-It helps identify issues and fix bugs before they become bigger problems.
- It helps promote collaboration among different developers and designers.
-Ensuring security. Software engineers implement measures to protect sensitive data and this eventually reduces cyber security threats.
Key milestones in the development of software engineering include;
-Between 2002-2010 Agile Methodologies gained prominence focusing on customer value and iterative develoment exemplified by frameworks like Scrum.
-Between 1983-1992 The rise of personal computers shifted focus to user friendly software, with the introduction of object oriented programming enhancing productivity through software reuse.
- Between 1968-1982 The formal establishment of software engineerig, introducing methodologies to enhance quality and productivity.
List and briefly explain the phases of the software development life cycle
-Planning. This includes setting goals and resources including costs and timelines.
-Design. This is basically outlining the architecture and data structures based on the requirements.
-Development. This involves the coding process according to the specifications of the design.
-Testing. Checking the software for bugs and ensuring it meets the requirements.
-Implementation. Deploying the software  to alive environment.
-Maintenance, This inolves maintaining thr  software. for example checking for bugs.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide scenarios where each would be appropriate
-Waterfall Methodology. It is a linear sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Its stages include implementation and testing.
-it provides a clear structure making it easy to manage projects.
- It is ideal for projects with stable requirements such as construction and manufacturing.
Agile methodology. It is an iterative approach that promotes flexibility and collaboration.
-it allows for rapid changwes.
-it is best suited for dynamic environments like mobile app projects.
Roles and responsibilities of a software developer, quality assurance engineer and project manager in a software engineering team
-Software developer
-Coding. writting codes using appropriate programming languages.
-Testing and debugging. conducts test to identify and fix bugs.
-Design. Creates software architecture that aligns with user requirement.
-Quality assurance engineer.
-Test Planning. Develops a test strategy and plan to ensure all aspects of the software are evaluated.
-Defect reporting. Documents and communicates any issues found during testing.
-Collaboration. Works closely with developers and stakeholders to understand requirement and provide feedback.
Project manager.
-Project planning. defines project scope objectives and timelines.
-risk management. identifies risks and develops strategies to minimize them.
-Budget oversight. manages project oversight.
Discuss the importance of IDEs and VSC in software development process. give examples of each.
-IDEs streamline the coding process by providing a comprehensive suite of tools within a single interface. examples include visual studio and eclipse.
-VSC allows developers to track revision collaborate on projects and maintain a history of changes. examples include Git and Subversion.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers. provide strategies to overcome this.
-Rapid technology change. keeping up with new languages can be overwhelming. The strategy can be to allocate time for continous learning .
-Time constaints. tight deadlines lead to decreased quality of work. The strategy can be prioritie tasks using time management techniques.
-Limited resources. Inadequate Infrastructure can hinder development. The strategy could be to advocate for necessary tools and resources.
-Security concerns. Protecting software from threats is critical. The strategy could be to integrate security practices in the development process.
Explain the different types of testing and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing
This involves testung individual components of the sotware in isolation to verify that each part works as intended.
-It helps to identify bugs early in the development peocess 
-It facilitates code refactoring by ensuring that changes do not introduce new errors.
-Integration testing 
This phase tests the interaction between integrated components to ensure they work together correctly.
-It identintifies interface defects and ensure that combine parts function as expected.
-System testing.
-This type tests the complete and intergrated software system to evaluate its compliance with specified requirements.
-It assesses the overall behaviour of the application in a simulated environment ensuring that all components work together.
Part 2. Introdduction to AI and prompt engineering.
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AImodels.
-Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining specific instructions or questions to effectively interact with AI models.
-Importance
-Enhance output quality. well designed prompts guide AI models to generate more coherent answers.
-Improve user experience. By providing clear instructions prompt engineering helps users achieve their desired outcome.
-Supports continous learning. models are able to learn from user feedback and improve overtime.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague prompt." Tell me about education in Africa."
-Clear prompt. "Tell me about the current state of education in Africa , the challenges it faces and long term solutions that can be made"
-The improved prompt is more effective because 
-Clarity. It specifies the information that it wants.
-Specificity. The prompt directs the AI to focus on the current state of education in Africa rather than providing a general overview.
-Conciseness. The prompt is staightfoward and to the point making it easy for the AI to understand.
