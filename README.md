#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering



Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline within  computer science that is focused on systematic design, development testing and maintenance of software.
It's importance in the technology industry include;
Driving Innovation. Software engineers are able to come up with applications and websites that help in solving issues in our society.
Ensuring security. Software engineers are able to come up with measures to protect sensitive data so as to reduce cyber threats.
Meet industry demand. The rise of software in different sectors has led to the demand for software engineers.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1940 to 1950. Development of the first programmable digital computers and high level programming languages.
1990s. The birth of world wide Web and Java script.
2000 to present. The rise of mobile applications cloud computing and agile methodologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning. This involves setting of goals and estimating costs.
Requirements analysis. Developers gather information about user needs and system requirements.
Design. Developers create designs based on requirements.
Development. The actual coding process begins.
Testing. The software undergoes thorough testing to fix bugs. 
Implementation. The software is deployed in an environment where users can access.
Maintenance. The software is supported as it is ongoing.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall.
Is a linear sequential approach. Here each phase must be completed before the next begins.
It is ideal for projects with stable requirements such as construction and manufacturing as it is not flexible to changes.

Agile.
It is an iterative approach. It is flexible and allows for customer collaboration. It is best suited for dynamic environment like software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer.
Testing and debugging. To perform quality checks.
Design and development Software. Create and maintain app.
Collaboration. To work together with the quality assurance engineer and project manager.

Quality Assurance Engineer.
Testing. Executing test plans to ensure Software quality.
Collaboration. To work together with the Software Developer ab the project manager.

Project Manager.
Project planning. Defining project scope and deadlines.
Communication. Serving as middle man between clients and development team  so as to help in things in managing expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDES. They streamline the coding process by providing a set of tools within one interface.
Its features include 
Debugger to fix errors in codes 
Interpreter to translate codes.
Examples include Visual studio and Eclipse.

VCS are crucial for managing changes to source code overtime. They allow for developers to collaborate. They include Git and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Limited resources. Inadequate infrastructure can hinder development.
Strategy. Advocating for necessary tools and resources.

Security concerns. Protecting software from threats is important.
Strategy. This can be curbed by including security practices in the development process.

Time constraints. Tight deadlines may lead to decreased  quality of work. 
Strategy. Prioritising tasks using time management techniques.

Poor communication. Misalignment between teams can lead to misunderstanding. 
Strategy. Open communication and regular check ins. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing. 
Involves testing individual components of a Software so as to ensure each part works as intended.
Importance. helps identify bugs earlier in the development process and makes it easy to fix.

Integrated testing.
This phase tests interaction between integrated components to ensure they work well together.
Importance. It ensures the combined parts function as expected.

System testing.
This tests the complete and integrated software to evaluate its alignment with requirements.
Importance. It assess the overall behaviours and performance of the application.

Acceptance testing.

It is conducted by stakeholders to determine whether the software meets needs and is necessary for deployment.
Importance. It helps reduce risks past deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing specified instructions or questions to effectively interact with AI models.
Improtance;
Enhance output quality. Well crafted prompts guide the AI model to give appropriate responses.
Improve user experience. Through prompt engineering users are able to achieve their desired outcome with ease.
Supports continous learning. Prompt Engineering allows for the refinement of interactions.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt. "Tell me about education in Africa "
Clear prompt. " Tell me about the current state of education in Africa and how we can improve education in Africa".

The Clear prompt is more effective because. 
It is clear.It tells us the exact information needed.
Specific. The prompt is specific as it says current and not the last ten years ago. This tells the AI what is specifically needed.
